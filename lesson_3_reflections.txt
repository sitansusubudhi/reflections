When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that we can perform push or pull operations easily on the repository from different places or from different persons.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It gives us the flexibility of choosing for ourselves when to update our repository as changes created automatically might lead to conflicts.
